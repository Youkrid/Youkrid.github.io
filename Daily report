Undertanding the modele, and find a physique application, the boundarys and initial condition. 
The modele will deal with a copper bar with the physics datas like teh density, the specific heat, the thermal conductivity. 
This is a bar with a length of 80 cm and isolated. 
For the start, I use the boundarys conditions u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0 and the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x) with f(x) = 100 sin(\pi * x / 80). 

I found my exact_solution, my boundarys conditions and my initial condition. 
In a second time, I learn how to use Julia and how to deal with a knew language. I learn about array, Diff√©rential equation, ... 
I will now try to solve the heat equation 1D with Julia. 

I use finite differential to modelise the problem, then I transform it to a linear system. Now I have my modele I can translate it into Julia and solve the heat equation in 1d. 

I finish to solve the heat equation, I have to test the error but the courbe is the same taht the exact solution.
